# Manager-Bot
Manager Bot is a Discord bot that comes with a variety of functions currently being built. It will include games, moderation commands, music commands, and much more. It is also completely free and open-source!

The Manager Bot project is currently paused for the time being, as the creator is working on another bot with someone. It will continue to be updated later on in the future!

**How to add the bot to your server:**

1. Make sure you have permissions to add the bot to the server you want to add it to.

2. Go to the following link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769306404720214028&permissions=0'
        '&scope=bot')

3. Do the steps shown on screen

The bot will then join your server that you added it to. If you have any questions, make sure to ask @cryptopig on GitHub.
